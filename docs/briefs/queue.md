# Briefs Queue

Active briefs ready for execution by the D182 v1 non-blocking automation system.

## How this file works

Briefs live as individual files in `docs/briefs/`. This file is the operator-facing queue showing what's ready, what's in flight, and what's done. Cowork (when scheduled in Phase 4) reads this file to find the next brief with `status: ready`.

When a brief moves through the lifecycle, update the row here. Detailed state lives in `docs/runtime/runs/{brief_id}-{timestamp}.md`.

## Active queue

## Status legend

- **ready** — brief authored, frontmatter complete, awaiting execution
- **running** — Cowork has picked it up
- **questions_pending** — Cowork has written to `claude_questions.md`, awaiting `claude_answers.md`
- **validation_pending** — output ready for GitHub Actions validation
- **review_required** — validation passed, awaiting PK morning approval
- **done** — PK has approved and applied (move to Recently completed)
- **failed** — something went wrong; PK to inspect state file and decide next step
- **blocked** — Tier 2/3 escalation hit; PK must reset to ready manually

## Adding a new brief

1. Create `docs/briefs/{brief-id}.md` with v1 frontmatter (see `docs/runtime/automation_v1_spec.md`)
2. Add row to Active queue table above
3. Set `status: ready` in the brief frontmatter
4. Commit

That's it. The brief is now visible to Cowork.
