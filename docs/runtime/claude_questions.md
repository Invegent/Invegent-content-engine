# Claude Questions — Async Inbox

**Purpose:** Async question channel for the non-blocking execution model (D182).

**Writer:** Claude Cowork (or chat session) when executing a brief and hitting a decision point.

**Reader:** OpenAI API (overnight, when Phase 4c lands) or PK (morning).

**Discipline:** Append-only. Never edit existing entries. Never delete entries. Never move entries between sections. To resolve a question, append a resolution block under "Closed (resolution refs)" referencing the original Q-ID.

## Closed (resolution refs)

When a question is resolved, append a resolution block here referencing the original Q-ID. Do NOT move the original question entry from the Open section — leave it where it was written. The resolution block here is a back-pointer.

```
## Resolved Q-{brief-slug}-{nnn}

Resolved by: <Q-{...}-{nnn} answer in claude_answers.md | PK chat | obsolete>
Resolved at: {YYYY-MM-DDTHHMMSSZ}
Outcome: <decision A/B/C/custom + one-line summary>
```
